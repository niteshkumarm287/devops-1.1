# Login Page with FastAPI, Docker, and CI/CD 🚀

---

## Overview

This repository contains a FastAPI-based application showcasing a modern login page. The project integrates with Docker, a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions (GHA), and Google Cloud Artifact Registry (GCR) for seamless deployment.

## Features ✨

1. **Interactive Login Page**:  
   - A visually appealing login form with responsive design and animations.

2. **FastAPI Backend**:  
   - Serves the dynamic login page at the root endpoint (`/`).

3. **Dockerized Application**:  
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile ensures lightweight, production-ready images.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:  
   - Automated Docker image builds and pushes to Google Artifact Registry using GitHub Actions.

5. **Docker Compose Support**:  
   - Simplifies local development with container orchestration and port mapping.

6. **Google Cloud Integration**:  
   - Fully compatible with Google Cloud services, enabling streamlined deployment workflows.

---

## Prerequisites 🔧

1. **Google Cloud Setup**:
   - Enable Artifact Registry API in your GCP project.
   - Create a service account and configure Workload Identity Federation.

2. **Docker**:
   - Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and enable Kubernetes support if required.

3. **GitHub Setup**:
   - Store the `workload_identity_provider` and `service_account` information in the GitHub repository secrets.

## Instructions 🛠️

### 1. Local Development and Testing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cicd-python-app.git
   cd cicd-python-app
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies locally (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install -r app/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application locally:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

4. Access the app in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

### 2. Build and Run Dockerized Application 🐳

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t login-app:latest .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 login-app:latest
   ```

3. Access the app at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

### 3. Use Docker Compose for Local Deployment 🧩

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f compose.yml up
   ```

2. Stop the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f compose.yml down
   ```

---

### 4. CI/CD Workflow with GitHub Actions ⚡

The GitHub Actions pipeline is configured to:
1. Build the Docker image upon pushing changes to the `main` branch.
2. Authenticate with GCP using Workload Identity Federation.
3. Push the built image to Google Artifact Registry.

#### How It Works:
- On every `git push` to the `main` branch:
  - The GHA pipeline (`.github/workflows/gha.yml`) is triggered.
  - The Docker image is built and pushed to GCR.
- Use the Docker image in your GKE or cloud deployment.

#### Triggering the Workflow:
1. Push changes to the repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated FastAPI login app"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Verify the image in Google Artifact Registry:
   - Navigate to `Artifact Registry > Repositories > simple-application`.

## Future Enhancements 🚀

- Add endpoints for user authentication and database integration (e.g., Cloud SQL).
- Implement a Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment.
- Secure API using OAuth or JWT.

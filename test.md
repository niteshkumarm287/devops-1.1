## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **403 Access Denied**:
   - Ensure the Service Account has the correct roles and permissions.
   - Verify that the **Datadog Principal** is correctly added to the Service Account.

2. **Integration Verification Failed**:
   - Double-check the **Service Account Email** and ensure it matches the one created in GCP.
   - Ensure the **Service Account Token Creator** role is assigned.

3. **No Data in Datadog**:
   - Verify that the GCP project has active resources (e.g., Compute Engine instances, Cloud Storage buckets).
   - Check the Datadog logs for any errors.

---

## Conclusion

You have successfully integrated **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** with **Datadog**. This integration allows you to monitor your GCP resources, collect metrics, and analyze logs in Datadog.
